# According to task requirements, at the moment, there is no any restrictions for connection type, and level of private of the project.  

So using websockets for all interaction between client and server can be the best solution.

And websocket connection established only once, in time of user login success. Registration process before is required. After registration the client redirects user to login page, which is default page.
