### autogenerated by `vue create social-network` -> `Manually select features`-> check the:
- Babel
- TypeScript
- PWA
- Router
- Vuex(later repaced by pinia manually, with usage of the same `store` folder)
- CSS Pre-processors
- Linter / Formatter
### Next chose ... vue.js 3.x
- Use Babel alongside TypeScript (required for modern mode, 
auto-detected polyfills, transpiling JSX)? Yes
- Sass/SCSS (with dart-sass)
- ESLint with error prevention only
- Lint on save
- In dedicated config files
### next time try to create project using new way. `npm create vue@3`. It is recommended by vue.js team, but the project structure is different. And it is not looks very controllable. Check first the details, may be this new way has some extra not desirable initiative(auto updates, etc.), which always increase chance to have extra issues.
