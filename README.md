# task-social-network

## At the moment the recomendations are:
- DO NOT USE `zero` branch, which is default, it can be used later as final destination
- use your own branches , and merge them into `dev` branch, using pull requests
- start branches from "wip/" prefix, f.e.: `wip/the-name-of-branch` or from the "futures/" prefix, f.e.: `futures/my-new-success` 
- before start work session always refresh you local branch from remote, to not forget something or do not recreate the same twice
- after work session completed, even if the code not very polished, you should commit your changes into your branch to do not loose the local progress on the other computer(when you will open repo from other workplace), even if code is not very polished at the moment. It is your branch and you can use it as you want
