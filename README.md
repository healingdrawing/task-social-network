## At the moment the recomendations are:
- use your own branches , and merge them into `dev` branch, using pull requests
- start branches from "wip/" prefix, f.e.: `wip/the-name-of-branch` or from the "futures/" prefix, f.e.: `futures/my-new-success` 
- do not use `zero` branch, which is default, it can be used later as final destination
